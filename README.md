## Introduction

Based on a data file, we have proceeded to clean and standardize the data in order to draw conclusions.

The file contains records of shark attacks, and indicates place, time, injuries and also who has been attacked according to gender.

## Data cleaning

Since the file contains information that needs to be cleaned, the following actions are carried out to standardize:

1. Extraction of year, month and day based on CASE NUMBER.
2. Cleaning of null elements, either eliminated or replaced by "Unknown, so that the necessary filter is applied to obtain the necessary data.
3. Standardize the activities in which the shark attack has occurred.
4. Unified countries to be able to count attacks by location.
5. The AGE field has been filtered to be able to work with a representative set, as well as the SEX and FATAL fields. These fields are necessary for the corresponding analysis.

## Hypothesis

1. To locate in which country most of the shark attacks take place.
2. To know which gender is mainly attacked.
3. To know what age range is the victim of the attacks.
4. To analyze the activities in which the most attacks tend to occur.
5. To know to what extent the attacks are provoked by the victims.
6. To know what is the result of the attack 
(death/survival of the victims of the attacks). 

## Conclusions

1. The majority of attacks are located in the USA and Australia. This would be expected given the size of the coastline of both countries, as well as the ecosystem that is located in these countries.

2. The number of male victims is clearly higher than that of female victims.

3. The most targeted age range is rather young. This may be related to the type of activities where they occur mostly: swimming and surfing activities.

4. The majority of attacks are not provoked by the victims, so it is deduced that the shark defends itself in case of confusion or surprise when encountering the victim.

5. The activities practiced by the victims are swimming or bathing, and surfing sports. The sports practices may be related to the age of the victims.

6. The deceased victims are mostly male, but the level of survival is higher than the level of death.
